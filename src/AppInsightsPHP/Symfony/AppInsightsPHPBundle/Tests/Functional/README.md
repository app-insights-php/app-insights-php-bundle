# Functional Testing    

This isn't really a place with automated functional tests, it's more a sandbox for AppInsightsPHPBundle that 
you can using during this bundle development.

If you would like to manually test this bundle during development you might want to use [bin/console](bin/console)
CLI Application. 

First prepare [config/app_insights_php.php](config/app_insights_php.php) using `config/app_insights_php.php.dist` template.
If you provide valid App Insights Instrumentation Key you should be able to start using App Insights PHP CLI commands.
